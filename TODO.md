# TODO

## Important

- HTTP server
- API responses config (+ any status code in response)
- Live reload
- Dynamic mocking ($variable, such as $uuid $name and so on)
- Response latency simulation

## Extra

- UI
- Import OpenAPI spec and generate mock
- Multiple response support (fixed selection, random, cycle)
